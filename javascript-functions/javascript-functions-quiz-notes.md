- What is a function in JavaScript?
  a code block designed to execute a particular task
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  function keyword, function name, parameters, code block to be executed within curly braces
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  function name + passed arguments
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  the function definition sets up the task the function is designed to run, while calling the function makes it run the task with whatever arguments are passed
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  parameters are placeholder values, arguments are the actual inputs being passed to the function
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  parameters are useful for defining the overall task the function is meant to execute
