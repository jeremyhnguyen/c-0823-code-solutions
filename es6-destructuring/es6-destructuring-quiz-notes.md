## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  assigning properties of an object to individual variables
- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  let { property:variable, property: variable } = object;
  or
  let { firstName, lastName } = person;
- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  let [x, y, z] = function();
  or use rest syntax to store all remaining elements in a new array
  let [x, y, ...array2] = variable/function();
- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
  in destructuring you aren't creating new properties in an object or objects in an array, but instead assigning them individual variables so that they can be referenced vs. object/array literals which are constructing
